# Project Motivation
In this project, I am interestested in using Stack Overflow survey data in 2024 to answer the following three questions:
1. What are the most popular programming, scripting and markup languages used by professional developers?
2. What is the most popular operating system for developers?
3. What are the top paying technologies for professional developers?

# Installation
- You should install `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` packages to run the code in `main.ipynb`.
- The data used for analysis is from [Stack Overflow's 2024 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) with more than 65K responses. You should download the dataset and put it to the same folder before running the code.

# File Description
- `main.ipynb`: the notebook contains all codes for data wrangling and plotting
- `img/`: folder containing all visualizations of data analysis

# Results
<!-- TODO: add the link to the Medium post -->
The main findings of the code can be found at [this blog post]() on Medium.
